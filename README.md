##  Overview

**Future Predictor** is a sophisticated suite of Python applications designed to empower strategic life decisions. It comprises two powerful, standalone tools:

1.  **WealthForge Financial Advisor:** An AI-powered simulation engine that provides personalized investment guidance and projects yearly profits and losses across various risk profiles.
2.  **Mastery Calculator:** A goal-oriented predictive engine that calculates the exact timeline required to achieve top-percentile mastery in any field based on daily dedication.

This project demonstrates advanced programming concepts, algorithmic thinking, and a deep understanding of user-centric design, all built with pure Python.

##  Features

### WealthForge Financial Advisor
- **Risk Profile Analysis:** Choose from Low, Medium, and High-risk investment strategies.
- **Comprehensive Investment Database:** Detailed information on assets from Savings Accounts to Cryptocurrencies.
- **Advanced Projection Algorithm:** Simulates yearly profit/loss based on personalized savings and investment choices.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Gracefully manages invalid inputs and edge cases.

### Mastery Calculator
- **Personalized Goal Setting:** Define your target field, desired expertise level (top 1%, 5%, 10%, etc.), and daily time investment.
- **10,000-Hour Rule Implementation:** Calculates your path to mastery based on the renowned psychological principle.
- **Motivational Feedback:** Provides encouraging messages tailored to your level of ambition and dedication.
- **Clear Roadmap Output:** Delivers a precise timeline in days and years to achieve your goal.

##  Technical Architecture

Built entirely with pure Python, this project is a testament to the language's capability to build complex applications without external dependencies.

**Key Programming Concepts Demonstrated:**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** Data modeled using classes and objects for clarity and scalability.
- **Algorithmic Logic:** Implements custom financial and predictive algorithms.
- **Advanced Input Validation:** Robust error handling using `try-except` blocks and input sanitization.
- **String Formatting & UI Design:** Creates a clean, user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
- **Modular Functions:** Code is organized into reusable, single-purpose functions for maintainability.

##  Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/future-predictor.git
    cd future-predictor
    ```

2.  **Run the Financial Advisor:**

    ```

4.  **Follow the intuitive prompts** to receive your personalized future analysis.

##  Developer Note

This project was built as a deep dive into core Python programming. The constraint of using no external libraries was a conscious choice to master fundamentals like data structures, control flow, and algorithm design. The result is a powerful, self-contained application that highlights the elegance and effectiveness of pure Python.
